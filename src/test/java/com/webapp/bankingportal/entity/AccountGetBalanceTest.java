ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getBalance_9dd60a8cc9

Here are the test scenarios for the `getBalance()` method:

**Scenario 1: Get Initial Balance**

Details:
  TestName: getInitialBalance
  Description: Verify that the `getBalance()` method returns the initial balance value when the account is first created.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the account class with default values.
  Act: Call the `getBalance()` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned balance is 0.0.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the initial balance is 0.0, as expected when an account is first created. This test ensures that the `getBalance()` method returns the correct initial value.

**Scenario 2: Get Updated Balance**

Details:
  TestName: getUpdatedBalance
  Description: Verify that the `getBalance()` method returns the updated balance value after a transaction.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the account class with default values. Update the balance by calling a method that modifies the balance (e.g., `deposit()` or `withdraw()`).
  Act: Call the `getBalance()` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned balance is equal to the updated value.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `getBalance()` method returns the updated balance value after a transaction. This test ensures that the `getBalance()` method reflects the current balance state.

**Scenario 3: Get Balance for Null Account**

Details:
  TestName: getBalanceForNullAccount
  Description: Verify that the `getBalance()` method handles a null account instance.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null instance of the account class.
  Act: Call the `getBalance()` method.
  Assert: Assert that a `NullPointerException` is thrown.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `getBalance()` method throws a `NullPointerException` when called on a null account instance. This test ensures that the method handles null inputs correctly.

**Scenario 4: Get Balance for Uninitialized Balance**

Details:
  TestName: getBalanceForUninitializedBalance
  Description: Verify that the `getBalance()` method returns a default value when the balance is not initialized.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the account class with an uninitialized balance.
  Act: Call the `getBalance()` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned balance is 0.0 or a default value.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `getBalance()` method returns a default value when the balance is not initialized. This test ensures that the method handles uninitialized balance values correctly.

**Scenario 5: Get Balance for Edge Case Values**

Details:
  TestName: getBalanceForEdgeCaseValues
  Description: Verify that the `getBalance()` method returns correct values for edge case balance values (e.g., minimum or maximum double value).

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new instance of the account class with edge case balance values (e.g., `Double.MIN_VALUE` or `Double.MAX_VALUE`).
  Act: Call the `getBalance()` method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned balance value is equal to the expected edge case value.

Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the `getBalance()` method returns the correct edge case balance values. This test ensures that the method handles extreme balance values correctly.

These test scenarios cover various cases for the `getBalance()` method, including initial balance, updated balance, null account, uninitialized balance, and edge case values.
